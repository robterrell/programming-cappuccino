Preface
-------

"Cappuccino Programming" is a companion to the excellent ["Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X" (4th Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321774086/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0321774086&link_code=as3&tag=tlrobinsonnet-20) by Aaron Hillegass and Adam Preble. It teaches [Cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org/) programming to Cocoa novices and experts alike, and serves as documentation of some of the differences between Cocoa and Cappuccino.

Cocoa novices should read this document concurrently with "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X". Once completed they should have a solid understanding of both the Cocoa and Cappuccino programming environments.

Programmers already familiar with Cocoa can treat this document as a stand-alone "Cappuccino for Cocoa Programmers" primer.

This document references the 4th edition of ["Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321774086/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0321774086&link_code=as3&tag=tlrobinsonnet-20), and uses Cappuccino version 0.9.6.
